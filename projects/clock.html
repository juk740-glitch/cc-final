                <p>an experimental clock that considers time as cyclical, following the phases of the moon. the design shows time as a spiral 
                    surrounding the moon, with each full moon marked along the timeline</p>
                <p>as the tracker makes its way towards a full moon, the moon in the center gradually fades into full illumination. 
                    I represented this process of illumination by adjusting the alpha value of the moon's fill() color, and using map() 
                    to map it to the time it takes to travel between 2 full moons (approx 3 seconds). I include the full moon in the middle 
                    to visualize the direct connection between the timeline and the moon itself. I thought about how to represent internal 
                    reflection as a quality of the timeline, so I included prompts that represent the energy of each distinct full moon. 
                    Internal refelction thus becomes a marker of progress of time as well.</p>

                <p>1. My experimental clock tracks time according to the moon, distinguishing periods of time accoding to each full moon cycle. 
                    I reconstruct time as a cyclical process rather than linear, reflecting the natural cyclical nature of the moon's lifetime. 
                    Every cycles begin and end with a solar eclipse, which happens twice a year, 6 months apart. This clock proposes timekeeping 
                    through lived experience, defined through internal reflection and transformation. Since June of this year, I began paying 
                    attention to the moon and taking the time to understand what each new cycle brought. A full moon is known to be "charged" with 
                    energy that varies based on which astrological sign the moon is positioned in. Each full moon brings an energy that determines 
                    a lesson/theme that dictates your life until the next cycle. At every full moon, I also prompt the user to take in the energy 
                    of the moon and wonder for themselves: what will this full moon bring me?</p>
                    
                    <p>I struggle a lot with the linear nature of our standardized clock. To think there is an endpoint I must keep looking forward 
                    to and a past I should try and bury away does not come naturally to me at all. But when I started to reflect on how the phases 
                    of the moon were making me feel over this summer, I found that my experiences really did begin to align with each new cycle of 
                    the moon. In our current model of time, we travel across this linear path by conquering each new day to progress to the other, 
                    overcoming yesterday's challenge for the sake of tomorrow's success. Viewing my life progressing in alignment with the moon's 
                    cyclical nature was a recognition that everything is interconnected, and nothing truly disappears, but transforms and changes 
                    form.</p>

                    <p>2. The form of the clock was inspired by Thea Cooke's diagram of the hero's journey, where she visualizes the journey as a spiral. 
                    It is cyclical in form, but ends a level above the initial cycle to represent the protagonists transformation into a hero.
                    I wanted to adopt the spiral form to recognize that although time is cyclical, we are not stuck in the same cycle over and 
                    over-rather we go through cycles to enter new ones. I define each cycle by the occurence of the solar eclipse that happens 
                    twice every year, so each cycle goes through 6 full moons before a new cycle restarts. </p>
