                <p>this sketch is my interpretation of her description:</p>
                <p>It’s a stretch of sand and sea that feels endless, with the kind of breeze that slows everything down. 
                    The water shifts between blues and greens, and seems to invite you to just keep walking out into it. 
                    Around it, life hums quietly—palm trees, people passing, the warmth that lingers in the air. 
                    Sometimes there are stalls set up along the edge, filled with bright fabrics that ripple in the wind,
                    adding their own rhythm of color to the shoreline. What makes it special, though, is not just how it looks, 
                    but what it holds: it’s where my family comes together, where the year closes and begins again. It’s where we 
                    leave everything else behind, laugh more easily, and simply enjoy being with each other.</p>
