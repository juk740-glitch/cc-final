                <p>an optical illusion using the kansiza illusion that considers how and under what conditions can "home" be constructed</p>
                
               <div id="p5-wrapper">
                    <div id="p5-container">

                <p>When I came across the Kanizsa illusion, what immediately popped in my head was the Chinese character for "return", 
                    which looks like a large square with a smaller square nestled in the middle (回)。 I  previously worked on a project 
                    that explored how the concept of "homecoming" in chinese (回家）is challenged for feminine bodies and experiences. 
                    The Kanizsa illusion is result of modal completion of contours that despite the lack of a defined boundary of hue, 
                    color, or textural difference. By making the completed form of the Kansiza the character for "return," I wanted to 
                    reflect how home can form in the presence of boundaries, both visible and invisible.</p>
