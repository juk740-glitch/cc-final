                <p>My game follows a baby witch a quest to discover her great “source,” a mythical ball of light
                    and energy that lays hidden away deep in the Forest of Knowledge. Every witch has the
                    ultimate goal of getting closer to their personal “source.”</p>
                <p>Your source is dependent on the journey you take: the choices you make, 
                    the things you choose to bring along with you, the
                    answers you’re looking to find.</p>
                <p>I am drawing on my experience of attempting to understand what it means to live a life of
                        my own. Turning 23 has brought me this sudden consciousness that I have ultimate control
                        over my life, and that I can shape it to be whatever I like. When I was younger I recall being
                        worried because I didn’t know what I wanted to do in my life, but now I see so many paths in
                        front of me. This thought often brings me anxiety, but I have come to realize that the
                        answers to the “right” path comes naturally, so long as I am pursuing what is aligned with
                        my true desires and passions. To pursue what brings me excitement, wonder, and curiosity
                        is what my best friend, Olivia, called “getting closer to the source.” Upon hearing that from
                        her, I came to understand life not as a series of correct or incorrect steps, but a natural,
                        emergent process driven by a recognition and awareness of oneself.</p>                    
                <p>The witch is guided by three informants in the forest: the Empress, the Hanged Man, and
the Hermit. I drew from the Major Arcana of the tarot, the cards that represent the human
experience on the path of spiritual transformation, to reflect how I often consult tarot for
guidance in my own life</p>
