                <p>i was formally trained as a product designer at Columbia University, where I received a BA in Information Science 
                    with a concentration in UX/UI design. now, i'm pursuing an MFA in Design & Technology at Parsons School of Design 
                    to explore interaction design in the context of critical computation & speculative design.</p>
                <p>in my creative practice i want to consider the ways we can think of technology as something more than just a tool for our 
                    benefit. how does our relationship with technology change when we think of it as an artistic medium? what if 
                    technology had a soul? </p>
